### Hello World!

I'm a student taking an __Open Source Sofrware__ class.

My main IDE is an [**Atom**](https://atom.io) which provides lots of plug-ins.

One reason why I use the Atom is this: [_**A POWER MODE**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oiCYVqN3w).<br>
&ensp;&ensp;(This is a short video shows what the POWER MODE is.)

You can find this at [_here_](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode), I bet you will like it :smile:
