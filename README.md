### Hello

I'm taking an __Open Source Sofrware__ class.

My main IDE is an [_**Atom**_](https://atom.io) which provides lots of plug-ins.

One reason why I use the Atom is this: [_**A POWER MODE**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oiCYVqN3w)(This is a short video shows what is the POWER MODE.)

You can find this at [_here_](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode), I bet you will like it :smile:
